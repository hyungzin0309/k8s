## 문제
> Create a cronjob called dice that runs every one minute. Use the Pod template located at /root/throw-a-dice. The image throw-dice randomly returns a value between 1 and 6. The result of 6 is considered success and all others are failure.
<br>
The job should be non-parallel and complete the task once. Use a backoffLimit of 25.
<br>
If the task is not completed within 20 seconds the job should fail and pods should be terminated.
<br>
You don't have to wait for the job completion. As long as the cronjob has been created as per the requirements.
